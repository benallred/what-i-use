# What I Use

## Development (CLI)

- Package Managers
  - [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)
    - If you are on Windows 11, you should have this already
    - [Tab completion](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/Completion.md)
  - [scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/scoop)
    - I mostly use winget but there are some programs not available there yet
- Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal)
  - My [terminal settings](https://github.com/benallred/configs/blob/master/powershell/settings.json)
- Shell: [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
  - This is not _Windows_ PowerShell that ships with Windows. That is PowerShell v5. This is cross-platform PowerShell that is decoupled from Windows so it gets updates more often and is several versions beyond Windows PowerShell at this point.
  - My [profile](https://github.com/benallred/configs/blob/master/powershell/profile.ps1)
- Upgraded shell input: [PSReadLine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine)
  - Technically, you already have this if you're using PowerShell. But have you considered [tweaking it](https://github.com/benallred/configs/blob/master/powershell/PSReadLine.ps1) to make it even better?
- Upgraded shell prompt: [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev)
  - My [prompt theme](https://github.com/benallred/configs/blob/master/powershell/ben.omp.json)
- Source Control: [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git)
  - My [gitconfig](https://github.com/benallred/configs/blob/master/git/ben.gitconfig)
  - Tab completion: [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)
- GitHub CLI: [gh](https://cli.github.com)
  - [Tab completion](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_completion)
- AWS CLI: [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/cli)
  - [Tab completion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html#cli-command-completion-windows)
